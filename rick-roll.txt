<<<<<<< HEAD
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We know the game and we're gonna play it
=======
We've known each other for so long
>>>>>>> verse-2
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
